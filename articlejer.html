            Sacred Sites
        </div>
        <div class="text" style="margin: 5vh;">
            One of Jerusalem's most captivating features is its abundance of sacred sites. The city is central to three major world religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The Western Wall, a remnant of the Second Temple, is one of Judaism's most hallowed sites. Just above it lies the Noble Sanctuary or Haram al-Sharif, home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, which holds significant importance in Islam.
            Christianity's deep connection to Jerusalem is also evident through numerous pilgrimage sites, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, believed to be the site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. These sacred locations not only draw millions of pilgrims each year but also symbolize the city's rich spiritual mosaic.
